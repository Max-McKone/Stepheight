                <h1>THE WORLD OF KICKING BRASS</h1>

                <h2>You awaken with no memory of your past, there’s a talking tuba on your head and it wants you to fight!</h2>

                <p>
                    Drawing on the Tuba Knight memes, Kicking Brass is set in a world where music dictates everyday life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tools, weapons, clothing and everyday objects are replaced by instruments, whose music is intrinsically magical.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Each family of instruments has unique abilities and shapes the way their users live. The Emperor Brasshoven of the Brass Empire, however, has begun pitting warriors and citizens against each other in his arena for his amusement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Somehow Gurdy, a teen with no memory of their past has been taken for the arena and now sports a talking tuba on their head. Not all bad though, this tuba seems to have granted Gurdy the ability to play any instrument as well as evade defeat, at least briefly!

                </p>

                <p>
                    It is up to Gurdy to fight their way to the top of the arena and free themselves from this strange limbo.
                </p>



                <h1>THE COLOSSEUM</h1>

                <img src={kb_img1} alt="Colosseum" className='img1' />

                <h2>The gates to King Brasshoven’s colosseum open once again!</h2>

                <h3>
                    For centuries only the strongest, bravest, and dumbest warriors from all over the continent have made their way to these sacred grounds in order to prove themselves (and/or die horrifically).
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Inspired by the Tuba Knight memes, this third-person bullet hell roguelike places you in an arena where music is your only defense.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shoot your way through wave after wave of trumpet-wielding enemies and weird, whimsical bosses. With over 50 instruments and items to choose from, your options are endless!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The magical tuba on your head can save you a few times but fail too often and you start over.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Collect gear, upgrade it, and master your instruments to prove your dominance over the other arena contestants.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Every 10th wave you must face a former champion of the Arena, such as Gatling Gary: an experimental amalgamation of instruments and steampunk tech.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Shopkeepers Floog, Elvo, Melven and Jerome are there to supply you with fresh gear to improve your odds.

                            Your inventory is divided into three main sections. The first section is shaped like a plus sign and is reserved for Equipment — these are your passive clothing Items such as Headwear, Gloves, Chest/back pieces, Shoes, Trousers, and Trinkets like necklaces. Remember, only one piece of Equipment per type can be worn at a time.

                            The second section contains your Active Items, which are the most frequently used. This section is always visible and includes three item boxes. You can use the Items by pressing the default keys [1], [2], or [3]. Active Items with cooldowns will show a timer until they're ready again, while consumables will disappear after use, freeing up their slot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The third section holds your Instruments, with space for up to three. To switch between them, use the scroll wheel or the default keys [Q] and [E]. When viewing the full inventory, you can rearrange Items by dragging them to a new slot or remove them from your inventory by dragging them out into the surrounding empty space.

                            At the start of your journey, you have three hearts. Each enemy hit will cost you one heart, so guard them carefully! To increase your heart count, pick up a max heart. To replenish health, consume Items like cookies. However, beware: if you lose all your hearts, you'll be sent back to your last checkpoint, as long as you have extra lives remaining. Run out of extra lives, and you'll have to start over from the beginning of your run.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes, you might find a [glass heart]. Think of this as a temporary shield; it can take one hit before shattering. If you avoid taking damage, the [glass heart] will still vanish after a brief period. So make good use of it while it lasts!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Understand the Notes and Shattering system:
                            Enemy projectiles deal varying amounts of damage based on their musical notation. An [8th] note, the smallest projectile, inflicts half a heart of damage. These can be linked together by a beam, forming [2-8ths] or [3-8ths]. When hit by connected notes, the damage you take is cumulative of the number of [8th] notes connected. A [4th] note will damage one heart, a [half] note takes away two hearts, and a [whole] note will deplete four hearts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Projectiles follow different paths based on their originating instrument. While the lyre and trumpet fire in straight lines, the saxophone arcs its shots, and the violin's notes orbit around. Some weapons don't emit projectiles, offering unique strategies to discover.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shattering is a defensive technique allowing you to break projectiles. When shattered, they reverse direction and split into two, each inflicting half the original damage. For instance, shatter a [half] note to get two [4th] notes. Shatter connected [8th] notes, and they'll break into individual notes. However, [ghost notes]—like those from a violin—won't cause damage unless shattered. Upon impact with a shattered [ghost note], it transforms into damaging [8th] notes.
                        </p>
