          What we stand for: <i>“Stepheight is the natural outcome of a desire to make video games”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          - is what Oskar once said when asked to describe our group and why we do what we do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our studio is driven by the passion of developing a video game, no matter where we are, who we are, or what our circumstances might be. Our team started doing this in an area where game development is basically unheard of, while also juggling university, side jobs, and a handful of personal challenges. We want Stepheight to be a beacon of what is possible, no matter what restrictions one might face.
