                    Three indie devs, setting out to create innovative games, hand in hand with their community!

                <p>
                    Forming for what was originally a university project, Stepheight is one of a handful of developers trying to make games in Thuringia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Driven by an eagerness to create games in a region where very few people have tried so far, we seek to show that anybody can make games anywhere, regardless of background or location.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our dedication stems from our desire to build a community, locally but also online.
                    We hope to cultivate an active following that wants to interact with us and help make our games be the best it can be.
